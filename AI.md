# AI-Assisted iP Development Log

This document chronicles the use of AI tools in the development of this project.

## Tooling: VS Code MCP Toolkit with Gemini

The primary development environment utilizes the **VS Code MCP (Multi-platform Coding Platform) toolkit**, which integrates Google's Gemini model as an interactive coding agent. This setup allows for a conversational approach to software development directly within the IDE.

### Gemini Coding Agent Functionality

The Gemini agent provides a suite of capabilities to accelerate development, including:

*   **Code Generation and Modification:** Writing new code from scratch, refactoring existing code, and fixing bugs based on natural language prompts.
*   **Codebase Comprehension:** Reading and analyzing the entire project to understand existing conventions, structures, and logic.
*   **File System Operations:** Creating, deleting, and modifying files and directories.
*   **Shell Command Execution:** Running build scripts, executing tests, and interacting with version control (Git) to manage the project lifecycle.
*   **Search and Discovery:** Finding relevant code snippets, files, or configurations across the workspace.

This integrated approach aims to minimize manual coding by leveraging AI to handle tasks ranging from simple boilerplate to complex logic implementation, allowing the developer to focus on high-level design and problem-solving.
